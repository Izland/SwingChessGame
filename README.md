# Chess Game

## A fun chess experience that can be play with 1 or 2 players

This application is designed so that either 1 or 2 people can play chess on a computer.
**Anyone interested in chess that knows the rules of chess and is capable of using a computer will be able to
use this application**, and hopefully have fun doing it.

Things being worked on:

-assignPiece() might be able to just use the piece's current location instead of another parameter

-Change variables to have local unique names instead of similar global variable names

-Add a computer AI to play against
