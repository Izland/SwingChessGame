# Chess Game

## A fun chess experience that can be play with 1 or 2 players

This application is designed so that either 1 or 2 people can play chess on a computer.
**Anyone interested in chess that knows the rules of chess and is capable of using a computer will be able to
use this application**, and hopefully have fun doing it.

Things being worked on:

-Changing the scale of the icons to fit within the box.

-Changing methods so that chess pieces cannot move through a piece

-Checking for a check/checkmate
