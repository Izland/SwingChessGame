# Chess Game

## A fun chess experience that can be play with 1 or 2 players

This application is designed so that either 1 or 2 people can play chess on a computer.
**Anyone interested in chess that knows the rules of chess and is capable of using a computer will be able to
use this application**, and hopefully have fun doing it.

Note: Special moves such as castling and en passant have not been implemented yet.

Things I'd like to work on:

-Optimize move generation algorithm

-Allow special types of moves (Castling, en passant)

-Change variables to have local unique names instead of similar global variable names
